### Solutions for session 1 from pvanheus (Peter)

[GiftGivers.py](GiftGivers.py) implements the solution in 
Python, using integer maths (as opposed to the floating point
maths shown in the actual session). The [com/github/pvanheus](com/github/pvanheus)
folder contains a solution in Java (for what its worth:
Java is far from being my "first language").
