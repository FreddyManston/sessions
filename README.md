# UWC Algorithms Circle sessions
This repository contains a log of code and discusssions from the Algorithms Circle sessions. 

Discussions can take place on our subreddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/uwcalgo/

Each session has its own directory in which there is a summary of the session and the code for the problems of that session.

### Code
Problems are split into 3 categories: easy, medium and hard.
Each category will have its own folder within the logs folders.

### Submitting code to the repository

To submit code to the repository you're going to need to know some *GitHub* and *git* techniques:

1. Create your own fork of the *sessions* repository. Forking is done using the *Fork* button in the top right corner of the GitHub page. You can learn more about it in [this guide](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/).
2. Clone (checkout) the repository that you have created. Make sure you are cloning your fork, not the main `uwcalgo/sessions` repository.
3. Navigate to the directory associated with the problem you're solving, e.g. `3/easy`. Create a directory named after your GitHub username (e.g. `3/easy/pvanheus`) and put your code in that directory.
4. Now send your code to GitHub with **git add**, **git commit** and **git push**.
5. Finally submit a [Pull Request](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/#making-a-pull-request) to notify the *uwcalgo* team of your code. We'll review it and incorporate it as necessary.

To understand more about **git** here's a [basic intro](http://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/) and a [free book](http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Git-Basics) on the subject.
